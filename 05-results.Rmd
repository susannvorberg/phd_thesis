## Optimizing Full-Likelihood 

The full likelihood of the maximum entropy model cannot be optimized with [ML](#abbrev) methods due to the exponential complexity of the partition function (see section \@ref(maxent)).
As elaborated in the introduction, many approximations to maximum likelihood inference have been developed that resolve the computational intractability of the partition function. 
Pseudo-likelihood methods are now the state-of-the-art model for contact prediction that outperformed other approximations like mean-field methods or methods based on the Bethe-approximation or sparse inverse covariance. 
Even though pseudo-likelihood maximation has been shown to be a consistent estimator in the limit of infinite data [@Besag1975 @Aurell2012], it is not clear how well pseudo-likelihood approximation is for real-world datasets. 



### Likelihood Gradient

### Contrastive Divergence

CD is about the difference between the original data set and a perturbed data set 
perturbed data set : The contrasting data set needs to represent A data sample characteristic of the current PARAMETERS --> Gibbs Sampling starting from data
Note: as contrasting dataset towards true_parameters, the elements of the gradient converge to the gradient of the max log likelihood
â€“ At the limit of the Markov chain, the CD converges to the actual MLE
