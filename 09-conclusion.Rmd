# Conclusion

This is the end


- alternative approach as good as pLL
  - very similar ranking --> no gain by combining both scores 
  - why no improvement for small alignments: apparantly conservation more important than coevolution
  
- much info in coupling information than is unused (shown in chapter 3)
- heuristics that migh be reason why CD doesn not improve over pLL

- bayesian model:
  - explicit modelling of coupling information
  - no need of heuristics (byebye APC) and estimates of probabilities --> enables cutoffs for contact prediction!
  - why no improvement:
    - diagonal matrices require more components
    - more data
    - assumption that hessian diagonal block matrices are zero
  
outlook:
  - extension to residue-residue distances
