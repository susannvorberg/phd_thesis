# Optimizing the Full Likelihood {#optimizing-full-likelihood}

Section \@ref(maxent) introduced the *Potts model* for contact prediction that is able to distinguish between directly and indirectly coupled residue pairs by jointly modelling the probabilty of a protein sequence over all residues.
Maximum-likelihood inference of the model parameters is numerically challenging due to the exponential complexity of the partition function that normalizes the probability distribution. 
Several approximate inference techniques for the full likelihood have been developed trying to sidestep the exact computation of the partition function.
At this point in time, pseudo-likelihood is the most successful approximate solution with regard to predicting residue-residue contacts (see section \@ref(pseudo-likelihood)).
It has been shown that the pseudo-likelihood is a consistent estimator to the full likelihood in the limit of large amounts of data.
However, it is unclear whether it represents a good approximation when there is only little data, in other words for small protein families that are the most interesting targets for contact prediction (see Figure \@ref(fig:pfam)).

While the partition function of the full likelihood cannot be efficiently computed, it is possible to approximate the gradient of the full likelihood with an approach called *contrastive divergence* that makes use of [MCMC](#abbrev) sampling techniques [@Hinton2002]. 
This section elaborates on how *contrastive divergence* can be used to optimize the full likelihood with gradient descent techniques.
Furthermore, two aspects of the underlying *Potts model*, namely gap treatment and the choice of regularization, have been refined which is explained in detail in methods section \@ref(potts-full-likelihood). 


## Approximating the Gradient of the Full Likelihood with Contrastive Divergence {#full-likelihood-gradient}

The gradient of the regularized full log likelihood with respect to the couplings $\wijab$ can be written as
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial \LLreg}{\partial \wijab} = \; N_{ij} q(x_i \eq a, x_j=b) - N_{ij} \; p(x_i \eq a, x_j \eq b | \v,\w) - \lambda_w \wijab  \; ,
(\#eq:gradient-wijab-full-likelihood-approx)
\end{equation}
where $N_{ij} q(x_i \eq a, x_j=b)$ are the empirical pairwise amino acid counts, $p(x_i \eq a, x_j \eq b | \v,\w)$ corresponds to the marginal distribution of the *Potts model* and $\lambda_w \wijab$ is the partial derivative of the L2-regularizer used to constrain the couplings $\w$.
The empirical amino acid counts are constant and need to be computed only once from the alignment.
The model probability term cannot be computed analytically as it involves the partition function that has exponential complexity. 


[MCMC](#abbrev) algorithms are predominantly used in Bayesian statistics to generate samples from probability distributions that involve the computation of complex integrals and therefore cannot be computed analytically [@Andrieu2003; @Murphy2012]. 
Samples are generated from a probability distribution as the current state of a running Markov chain. 
If the Markov chain is run long enough, the equilibrium statistics of the samples will be identical to the true probability distribution statistics.
In 2002, Lapedes et al. applied [MCMC](#abbrev) sampling to approximate the probability terms in the gradient of the full likelihood [@Lapedes2012a].
They obtained sequence samples from a Markov chain that was run for 4,000,000 steps by keeping every tenth configuration of the chain.
Optimization converged after 10,000 - 15,000 epochs when the gradient had become zero.
The expected amino acid counts according to the model distribution, $N_{ij} \; p(x_i \eq a, x_j \eq b | \v,\w)$, were estimated from the generated samples.
Their approach was successfull but is computationally feasible only for small proteins and points out the limits of applying [MCMC](#abbrev) algorithms.
Typically, they require many sampling steps to obtain unbiased estimates from the stationary distribution which comes at high computational costs.

In 2002, Hinton invented *Contrastive Divergence* as an approximation to [MCMC](#abbrev) methods [@Hinton2002].
It was originally developed for training products of experts models but it can generally be applied to maximizing log likelihoods and has become popular for training restricted Boltzmann machines [@Fischer2012; @Murphy2012; @Bengio2009]. 
The idea is simple: instead of starting a Markov chain from a random point and running it until it has reached the stationary distribution, it is initialized with a data sample and evolved for only a small number of steps.
Obviously the chain has not yet converged to its stationary distribution and the data sample obtained from the current configuration of the chain presents a biased estimate.
The intuition behind [CD](#abbrev) is, that eventhough the gradient estimate is noisy and biased, it points roughly into a similar direction as the true gradient of the full likelihood.
Therefore the approximate [CD](#abbrev) gradient should become zero approximately where the true gradient of the likelihood becomes zero.
Once the parameters are close to the optimum, starting a Gibbs chain from a data sample should reproduce the empirical distribution and not lead away from it, because the parameters already describe the empirical distribution correctly.

The approximation of the likelihood gradient with [CD](#abbrev) according to the *Potts* model for modelling protein families is visualized in Figure \@ref(fig:cd-gibbs-sampling).
$N$ Markov chains will be initialized with the $N$ sequences from the [MSA](#abbrev) and $N$ new samples will be generated by a single step of Gibbs sampling from each of the $N$ sequences.
One full step of Gibbs sampling updates every sequence position $i \in \{1, \ldots, L\}$ subsequently by randomly selecting an amino acid based on the conditional probabilities for observing an amino acid $a$ at position $i$ given the model parameters and all other (already updated) sequence positions:
\begin{equation}
  p(\seq_i = a | (x_1, \ldots, x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, \ldots, x_L), \v, \w) \propto \exp \left( \vi(a) + \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ i \ne j}}^L \wij(a, x_j)  \right)
(\#eq:conditional-prob-full-likelihood)
\end{equation}
The generated sample sequences are then used to compute the pairwise amino acid frequencies that correspond to rough estimates of the marginal probabilities of the *Potts* model.
Finally, an approximate gradient of the full likelihood is obtained by subtracting the sampled amino acid counts from the empirical amino acid counts as denoted in eq. \@ref(eq:gradient-wijab-full-likelihood-approx).
 
(ref:caption-gibbs-sampling) Approximating the full likelihood gradient of the *Potts* model with [CD](#abbrev). Pairwise amino acid counts are computed from the observed sequences of the input alignment shown in red on the left. 
Expected amino acid frequencies according to the model distribution are computed from a sampled alignment shown in blue on the right. The [CD](#abbrev) approximation of the likelihood gradient is obtained by computing the difference in amino acid counts of the observed and sampled alignment. A newly sampled sequence is obtained by evolving a Markov chain, that is initialized with an observed sequence, for one full Gibbs step. The Gibbs step involves updating every position in the sequence (unless it is a gap) according to the conditional probabilities for the 20 amino acids at this position.

```


The next sections elucidate the optimization of the *Potts* model full likelihood with [CD](#abbrev) to obtain an approximation to the gradient.


## Optimizing the Full Likelihood {#full-likelihood-optimization}

Given the likelihood gradient estimates obtained with [CD](#abbrev), the full negative log likelihood can now be minimized using a gradient descent optimization algorithm.
Gradient descent algorithms are used to find the minimum of an objective function with respect to its parametrization by iteratively updating the parameters values in the opposite direction of the gradient of the objective function with respect to these parameters.
*Stochastic* gradient descent ([SGD](#abbrev)) is a variant thereof that uses a stochastic estimate of the gradient whose average over many updates approaches the true gradient.
The stochasticity is commonly obtained by evaluating a random subsample of the data at each iteration. 
For [CD](#abbrev) stochasticity additionally arises from the Gibbs sampling process in order to obtain a gradient estimate in the first place.

As a consequence of stochasticity, the gradient estimates are noisy, resulting in parameter updates with high variance and strong fluctuations of the objective function.
These fluctuations enable stochastic gradient descent to escape local minima but also complicate finding the exact minimum of the objective function. 
By slowly decreasing the step size of the parameter updates at every iteration, stochastic gradient descent most likely will converge to the global minimum for convex objective functions [@Ruder2017; @Bottou2012; @Bottou2010].
However, choosing an optimal step size for parameter updates as well as finding the optimal annealing schedule offers a challenge and needs manual tuning [@Schaul2013; @Zeiler2012]. 
If the step size is chosen too small, progress will be unnecessarily slow, if it is chosen too large, the optimum will be overshot and can cause the system to diverge (see Figure \@ref(fig:gd-learning-rate-intro)).
Further complications arise from the fact that different parameters often require different optimal step sizes, because the magnitude of gradients might vary considerably for different parameters, e.g. because of sparse data.

(ref:caption-gd-learning-rate-intro) Visualization of gradient descent optimization of an objective function $L(w)$ for different step sizes $\alpha$. The blue dot marks the minimum of the objective function. The direction of the gradient at the initial parameter estimate $w_0$ is given as black arrow. The updated parameter estimate $w_1$ is obtained by taking a step of size $\alpha$ into the opposite direction of the gradient. **Left** If the step size is too small the algorithm will require too many iterations to converge. **Right** If the step size is too large, gradient descent will overshoot the minimum and can cause the system to diverge.

```{r gd-learning-rate-intro, echo = FALSE, out.width = '80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap = '(ref:caption-gd-learning-rate-intro)'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/full_likelihood/intro.png")
```

Unfortunately, it is neither possible to use second order optimization algorithms nor sophisticated first order algorithms like conjugate gradients to optimize the full likelihood of the *Potts* model.
While the former class of algorithms requires (approximate) computation of the second partial derivatives, the latter requires evaluating the objective function in order to identify the optimal step size via linesearch, both being computationally too demanding.

The next subsections describe the hyperparameter tuning for stochastic gradient descent, covering the choice of the convergence criterion and finding the optimal learning rate annealing schedule.

### Convergence Criterion for Stochastic Gradient Descent {#convergence-criteria-sgd}

In theory the gradient descent algorithm has converged and the optimum of the objective function has been reached when the gradient becomes zero. 
In practice the gradients will never be exactly zero, especially due to the stochasticity of the gradient estimates when using stochastic gradient descent with [CD](#abbrev).
For this reason, it is crucial to define a suitable convergence criterion that can be tested during optimization and once the criterion is met, convergence is assumed and the algorithm is stopped. 
Typically, the objective function (or a related loss function) is periodically evaluated on a validation set and the optimizer is halted whenever the function value saturates or starts to increase.
This technique is called early stopping and additionally prevents overfitting [@Bengio2012; @Mahsereci2017].
Unfortunately, we cannot compute the full likelihood function due to its complexity and need to define a different convergence criterion.

One possibility is to stop learning when the L2 norm of the gradient for the coupling parameters $||\nabla_{\w} L\!L(\v^*, \w)||_2$ is close to zero [@Carreira-Perpinan2005].
However, when using a finite number of sequences for sampling, the norm of the gradient does not converge to zero but towards a certain offset as it is described in section \@ref(cd-sampling-size).
Convergence could also be monitored as the relative change of the norm of gradients within a certain number of iterations.
Optimization will be stopped when the relative change becomes negligibly small, that is when the gradient norm has reached a plateau.
As gradient estimates are very noisy with stochastic gradient descent, gradient fluctuations complicate the proper assessment of this criterion.

Instead of the gradient, it is also possible to observe the relative change of the norm of parameter estimates $||\w||_2$ over several iterations and stop learning when it falls below a small threshold $\epsilon$,
\begin{equation}
  \frac{||\w_{t-x}||_2 - ||\w_t||_2}{||\w_{t-x}||_2} < \epsilon \; .
  (\#eq:parameter-convergence-criterion)
\end{equation}
This measure is less noisy than subsequent gradient estimates because the magnitude of parameter updates is bounded by the learning rate.

For stochastic gradient descent the optimum is a moving target and the gradient will start oscillating when approaching the optimum. 
Therefore, another idea is to monitor the direction of the partial derivatives.
However, this theoretical assumption is complicated by the fact that gradient oscillations are also typically observed when the parameter surface contains narrow valleys or generally when the learning rate is too big, as it is visualized in the right plot in Figure \@ref(fig:gd-learning-rate-intro).
When optimizing high-dimensional problems using the same learning rate for all dimensions, it is likely that parameters converge at different speeds [@Ruder2017] leading to oscillations that could either originate from convergence or yet too large learning rates. 
As can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:gradient-directions), the percentage of parameters for which the derivate changes direction within the last $x$ iterations is usually high and varies for different proteins.
Therefore it is not a good indicator of convergence.
When using the adaptive learning rate optimizer *ADAM*, the momentum term is an interfering factor for assessing the direction of partial derivatives.
Parameters will be updated into the direction of a smoothed historical gradient and oscillations, regardless of which origin, will be dampened.
It is therefore hard to define a general convergence criteria based on the direction of derivatives that can distinguish these different scenarios. 

(ref:caption-gradient-directions) Percentage of parameters for which the derivate has changed its direction (i.e. the sign) during the previous $x$ iterations ($x$ is specified in the legend). Optimization is performed with [SGD](#abbrev) using the optimal hyperparameters defined in section \@ref(sgd-hyperparameter-tuning) and using a regularization coefficient $\lambda_w \eq 0.1L$ (see section \@ref(regularization-for-cd-with-sgd)) and using one step of Gibbs sampling. Optimization is stopped when the relative change over the L2-norm of parameter estimates $||\w||_2$ over the last $x$ iterations falls below the threshold of $\epsilon \eq 1e-8$. Development has been monitored for two different proteins, **Left** 1c75A00 (protein length = 71, number sequences = 28078, [Neff](#abbrev) = 16808) **Right** 1ahoA00 (protein length = 64, number sequences = 378, [Neff](#abbrev) = 229). 

```{r gradient-directions, echo = FALSE, screenshot.alt="img/full_likelihood/sgd/percentage_changes_in_gradient_direction.png", out.width = '100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap = '(ref:caption-gradient-directions)'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/full_likelihood/sgd/percentage_changes_in_gradient_direction_1c75A00_1ahoA00.png")
```


Of course, the simplest strategy to assume convergence is to specify a maximum number of iterations for the optimization procedure, which also ensures that the algorithm will stop eventually if none of the other convergence criteria is met.

A necessary but not sufficient condition that is satisfied at the optimum when the gradient is zero, is given by $\sum_{a,b=1}^{20} \wijab = 0$ (see section \@ref(prior-v)).
This condition is never violated, as long as parameters satisfy this criterion at initialization and the same step size is used to update all parameters. 
To understand why, note that the 400 partial derivatives $\frac{\partial L\!L(\v^*, \w)}{\partial \wijab}$ for a residue pair $(i,j)$ and for $a,b \in \{1, \ldots, 20\}$ are not independent.
The sum over the 400 pairwise amino acid counts at positions $i$ and $j$ is identical for the observed and the sampled alignment and amounts to,

\begin{equation}
  \sum_{a,b=1}^{20} N_{ij} q(x_i \eq a, q_j \eq b) = N_{ij} \; .
\end{equation}

Considering a residue pair $(i,j)$ and assuming amino acid pair $(a,b)$ has higher counts in the sampled alignment than in the observed input alignment, then this difference in counts must be compensated by other amino acid pairs $(c,d)$ having less counts in the sampled alignment compared to the true alignment (see Figure \@ref(fig:visualisation-wijab-constraint)).
Therefore, it holds $\sum_{a,b=1}^{20} \frac{\partial L\!L(\v^*, \w)}{\partial \wijab} = 0$.
This symmetry is translated into parameter updates as long as the same step size is used to update all parameters. 
However, when using adaptive learning rates (e.g. with the *ADAM* optimizer), this symmetry is broken and the condition $\sum_{a,b=1}^{20} \wijab = 0$ can be violated during the optimization processs.
It is therefore interesting to monitor $\sum_{1 \le 1 < j \le L} \sum_{a,b=1}^{20} \wijab$.

(ref:caption-visualisation-wijab-constraint) The 400 partial derivatives $\frac{\partial \LLreg(\v^*,\w)}{\partial \wijab}$ at position $(i,j)$ for $a,b \in \{1, \ldots, 20 \}$ are not independent. Red bars represent pairwise amino acid counts at position $(i,j)$ for the sampled alignment. Blue bars represent pairwise amino acid counts at position $(i,j)$ for the input alignment. The sum over pairwise amino acid counts at position $(i,j)$ for both alignments is $N_{ij}$, which is the number of ungapped sequences. The partial derivative for $\wijab$ is computed as the difference of pairwise amino acid counts for amino acids $a$ and $b$ at position $(i,j)$. The sum over the partial derivatives $\frac{\partial \LLreg(\v^*,\w)}{\partial \wijab}$ at position $(i,j)$ for all $a,b \in \{1, \ldots, 20 \}$ is zero.

### Tuning Hyperparameters of Stochastic Gradient Descent Optimizer {#sgd-hyperparameter-tuning}

The coupling parameters $\w$ will be updated at each time step $t$ by taking a step of size $\alpha$ along the direction of the negative gradient of the regularized full log likelihood, $- \nabla_w \LLreg(\v^*,\w)$, that has been approximated with [CD](#abbrev),

\begin{equation}
  \w_{t+1} = \w_t - \alpha \cdot \nabla_w \LLreg(\v^*,\w) \; .
\end{equation}

In order to get a first intuition of the optimization problem, I tested initial learning rates $\alpha_0 \in  \{1\mathrm{e}{-4}, 5\mathrm{e}{-4}, 1\mathrm{e}{-3}, 5\mathrm{e}{-3}\}$ with a standard learning rate annealing schedule, $\alpha  = \frac{\alpha_0}{1 + \gamma \cdot t}$ where $t$ is the time step and $\gamma$ is the decay rate that is set to 0.01[@Bottou2012].

Figure \@ref(fig:performance-cd-alphaopt) shows the mean precision for top ranked contacts computed from pseudo-likelihood couplings and from [CD](#abbrev) couplings optimized with stochastic gradient descent using the four different learning rates. 
Overall, mean precision for [CD](#abbrev) contacts is lower than for pseudo-likelihood contacts, especially when using the smallest ($\alpha_0 \eq 1\mathrm{e}{-4}$) and largest ($\alpha_0 \eq 5\mathrm{e-}{3}$) learning rate.

```

By looking at individual proteins it becomes evident that the optimal learning rate depends on alignment size.
Figure \@ref(fig:sgd-single-proteins-initial-learning-rate) displays the development of the L2 norm of the coupling parameters, $||\w||_2$, during optimization using different learning rates for two proteins with different alignment sizes. 
The left plot shows protein 1c75A00 that has a large alignment with 28078 sequences ([Neff](#abbrev) = 16808) while the right plot shows protein 1ahoA00 that has a small alignment with 378 sequences ([Neff](#abbrev) = 229).
For protein 1ahoA00 and using a small initial learning rate $\alpha_0 \eq \mathrm{1e-4}$, the optimization runs very slowly and does not converge within tha maximum number of 5000 iterations.
Using a large initial learning rate $\alpha_0 \eq \mathrm{5e-3}$ results in slighly overshooting the optimum at the beginning of the optimization but with the learning rate decaying over time the parameter estimates converge. 
In contrast, for protein 1c75A00, the choice of learning rate has a more pronounced effect.
With a small initial learning rate  $\alpha_0 \eq \mathrm{1e-4}$ the optimization runs slowly but almost converges within 5000 iterations.
A large initial learning rate $\alpha_0 \eq \mathrm{5e-3}$ lets the parameters diverge quickly and the optimum cannot be recovered.
With learning rates $\alpha_0 \eq \mathrm{5e-4}$ and $\alpha_0 \eq \mathrm{1e-3}$, the optimum is well overshot at the beginning of the optimization but the parameter estimates eventually converge as the learning rate decreases over time.

These observations can be explained by the fact that the magnitude of the gradient scales with the number of sequences in the alignment.
The gradient is computed from amino acid counts as explained before.
Therefore, alignments with many sequences will generally produce larger gradients than alignments with few sequences, especially at the beginning of the optimization procedure when the difference in amino acid counts between sampled and observed sequences is largest.
Following these observations, I defined the initial learning rate $\alpha_0$ as a function of [Neff](#abbrev),

\begin{equation}
  \alpha_0 = \frac{5\mathrm{e}{-2}}{\sqrt{N_{\text{eff}}}} \; .
  (\#eq:learning-rate-wrt-neff)
\end{equation}

For small [Neff](#abbrev), e.g. 5th percentile of the distribution in the dataset $\approx 50$, this definition of the learning rate yields $\alpha_0 \approx 7\mathrm{e}{-3}$ and for large [Neff](#abbrev), e.g. 95th percentile $\approx 15000$, this yields $\alpha_0 \approx 4\mathrm{e}{-4}$. 
These values for $\alpha_0$ lie in the optimal range that has been observed for the two representative proteins in Figure \@ref(fig:performance-cd-alphaopt).
With the initial learning rate defined as a function of [Neff](#bbrev), precision slightly improves over the previous fixed learning rates (see Appendix Figure \@ref(fig:performance-cd-alphaopt-0)).
All following analyses are conducted using the [Neff](#abbrev)-dependent initial learning rate.

(ref:caption-sgd-single-proteins-initial-learning-rate) Convergence plots for two proteins during [SGD](#abbrev) optimization with different learning rates and convergence measured as L2-norm of the coupling parameters $||\w||_2$. Linear learning rate annealing schedule has been used with decay rate $\gamma=0.01$ and initial learning rates $\alpha_0$ have been set as specified in the legend. **Left** 1c75A00 (protein length = 71, number sequences = 28078, [Neff](#abbrev) = 16808). Figure is cut at the yaxis at $||\w||_2=1000$, but learning rate of $5\mathrm{e}{-3}$ reaches $||\w||_2 \approx 9000$. **Right** 1ahoA00 (protein length = 64, number sequences = 378,  [Neff](#abbrev) = 229)

```{r sgd-single-proteins-initial-learning-rate, echo = FALSE, out.width = '48%', fig.align='center', fig.show='hold', fig.cap = '(ref:caption-sgd-single-proteins-initial-learning-rate)'}

```

In a next step, I evaluated the following learning rate annealing schedules and decay rates using the [Neff](#abbrev)-dependent initial learning rate given in eq. \@ref(eq:learning-rate-wrt-neff):

- default linear learning rate schedule $\alpha  = \frac{\alpha_0}{1 + \gamma t}$ with $\gamma \in \{1\mathrm{e}{-3}, 1\mathrm{e}{-2}, 1\mathrm{e}{-1}, 1 \}$
- square root learning rate schedule $\alpha  = \frac{\alpha_0}{\sqrt{1 + \gamma t}}$ with $\gamma \in \{1\mathrm{e}{-2}, 1\mathrm{e}{-1}, 1 \}$
- sigmoidal learning rate schedule $\alpha_{t+1}  = \frac{\alpha_{t}}{1 + \gamma t}$ with $\gamma \in \{1\mathrm{e}{-6}, 1\mathrm{e}{-5}, 1\mathrm{e}{-4}, 1\mathrm{e}{-3}\}$
- exponential learning rate schedule $\alpha_{t+1}  = \alpha_0 \cdot\exp(- \gamma t)$ with $\gamma \in \{5\mathrm{e}{-4}, 1\mathrm{e}{-4}, 5\mathrm{e}{-3}\}$

The learning rate annealing schedules are visualized for different decay rates in Appendix Figure \@ref(fig:learning-rate-schedules).
Optimizing [CD](#abbrev) with [SGD](#abbrev) using any of the learning rate schedules listed above yields on average lower precision for the top ranked contacts than the pseudo-likelihood contact score.
Several learning rate schedules perform almost equally and yield a mean precision that is about one to two percentage below the mean precision for the pseudo-likelihood contact score (see Figure \@ref(fig:performance-cd-learnignrate-schedules)):
a linear learning rate schedule with decay rate $\gamma \eq 1\mathrm{e}{-2}$, a sigmoidal learning rate schedule with decay rates $\gamma \eq 1\mathrm{e}{-5}$ or $\gamma \eq 1\mathrm{e}{-6}$ and an exponential learning rate schedule with decay rates $\gamma \eq 1\mathrm{e}{-3}$ or $\gamma \eq 1\mathrm{e}{-5}$. 
The square root learning rate schedule gives ovarall bad results and does not lead to convergence because the learning rate decays slowly at later time steps.
The benchmark plots for all learning rate schedules are shown in Appendix section \@ref(benchmark-learning-rate-annealing-schedules).

Contact scores are computed as the [APC](#abbrev) corrected Frobenius norm of the couplings $\wij$. **pseudo-likelihood**:  couplings computed with pseudo-likelihood. **CD**: couplings computed with [CD](#abbrev) using stochastic gradient descent with an initial learning rate defined with respect to [Neff](#abbrev).

```


In contrast to the findings regarding the initial learning rate earlier, an optimal decay rate can be defined independent of the alignment size.
Figure \@ref(fig:sgd-single-proteins-learning-rate-schedule) shows the development of the L2 norm of the coupling parameters, $||\w||_2$, during optimization for the same two representative proteins with small and large alignments as before.
Convergence for protein 1ahoA00, having small [Neff](#abbrev)=229, is robust against the particular choice of learning rate schedule and decay rate and the presumed optimum at $||w||_2 \approx 13.2$ is reached regardless of the learning rate annealing schedule (see right plot in Figure \@ref(fig:sgd-single-proteins-learning-rate-schedule)).
For protein 1c75A00, with high [Neff](#abbrev)=16808, the choice of the learning rate schedule has a notable impact on the rate of convergence.
Using a linear schedule, the learning rate decays quickly but then converges to a certain offset, which effectively prevents further optimization progress and the presumed optimum at $||w||_2 \approx 90$  is not reached within 5000 iterations.
Learning rate schedules that decay slower but decay continously for 5000 iterations, such as an exponential schedule with $\gamma \eq 1\mathrm{e}{-3}$ or a sigmoidal schedule with $\gamma \eq 1\mathrm{e}{-6}$, guide the parameter estimates close to the expected optimum.
Therefore, learning rate schedules with an exponential or sigmoidal decay can be used with proteins having low [Neffs](#abbrev) as well as high [Neffs](#abbrev).

(ref:caption-sgd-single-proteins-learning-rate-schedule) L2-norm of the coupling parameters $||\w||_2$ during stochastic gradient descent optimization with different learning rates schedules.

Learning rate schedules and decay rates are used according to the legend. **Left** 1c75A00 (protein length = 71, number sequences = 28078, [Neff](#abbrev) = 16808). **Right** 1ahoA00 (protein length = 64, number sequences = 378,  [Neff](#abbrev) = 229)

```


Another aspect worth considering is runtime and it can be observed that the different learning rate annealing schedules differ in convergence speed.
Figure \@ref(fig:distribution-num-iterations) shows the distribution over the number of iterations until convergence for [SGD](#abbrev) optimizations with five different learning rate schedules that yield similar performance. 
The optimization converges on average within less than 2000 iterations only when using either a sigmoidal learning rate annealing schedule with decay rate $\gamma \eq 1\mathrm{e}{-5}$ or an exponential learning rate annealing schedule with decay rate $\gamma \eq 5\mathrm{e}{-3}$, 
On the contrary, the distribution  of iterations until convergence has a median of 5000 when using a linear learning rate annealing schedule with $\gamma \eq 1\mathrm{e}{-2}$ or an exponential schedule with decay rate $\gamma \eq 1\mathrm{e}{-3}$.
Under these considerations, I chose a sigmoidal learning rate schedule with $\gamma \eq 5\mathrm{e}{-6}$ for all further analysis.

Convergence is reached when the relative difference of parameter norms, $||\w||_2$, over the last five iterations falls below $\epsilon \eq 1e-8$. Initial learning rate $\alpha_0$ is defined with respect to [Neff](#abbrev) as given in eq. \@ref(eq:learning-rate-wrt-neff) and maximum number of iterations is set to 5000. Learning rate schedules and decay rates are specified in the legend.

```{r distribution-num-iterations, echo = FALSE, screenshot.alt="img/full_likelihood/sgd/distribution_numiterations_against_selected_learningrate_schedules.png", out.width = '100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap = '(ref:caption-distribution-num-iterations)'}
knitr::include_url("img/full_likelihood/sgd/distribution_numiterations_against_selected_learningrate_schedules.html", height = "500px")
```

Finally, I checked whether altering the convergence criteria has notable impact on performance.
Per default, optimization is stopped whenever the relative change of the L2 norm over coupling parameters, $||\w||_2$, over the last 5 iterations falls below a small value $\epsilon < 1e-8$ as denoted in eq. \@ref(eq:parameter-convergence-criterion).
Figure \@ref(fig:performance-cd-convergence-prev) shows that the mean precision over proteins is robust to different settings of the number of iterations over which the relative change is computed. 
The convergence rate is mildly affected by the different settings. 
Optimization converges on average within 1697, 1782 and 1917 iterations, when computing the relative change of the parameter norm over the previous 2,5 and 10 iterations, respectively (see Appendix Figure \@ref(fig:numit-convergence-convergence-prev)).
For all following analysis, I chose 10 to be the number of iterations over which the convergence criterion is computed.

## Tuning the Gibbs Sampling Scheme for Contrastive Divergence {#cd-sampling-optimization}

The original [CD](#abbrev)-k algorithm described by Hinton in 2002 evolves the Markov chains by k=1 Gibbs steps [@Hinton2002]. 
As described earlier, [CD](#abbrev)-1 provides a biased estimate of the true gradient because the Markov chains have not reached the stationary distribution [@Fischer2012]. 
Bengio and Delalleau show that the bias for [CD](#abbrev)-k kan be understood as a residual term when expressing the log likelihood gradient as an expansion that involves the k-th sample of the Gibbs chain [@Bengio2009].
As the number of Gibbs steps, k, goes to infinity the residual term and hence the bias converges to zero and the [CD](#abbrev) gradient estimate converges to a stochastic estimation of the true likelihood gradient.
Indeed, eventhough surprising results have been obtained by evolving the Markov chains for only one Gibbs step, typically [CD](#abbrev)-k for k>>1 gives more precise results [@Bengio2009].
Furthermore it has been shown, that bias also depends on the mixing rate (rate of convergence) of the chains whereby the mixing rate decreases when model parameters increase [@Tieleman2008].
This can lead to divergence of the [CD](#abbrev)-k solution from optimal solution in a sense that the model systematically gets worse as optimization progresses [@Fischer2010].
Regularization of the parameters offers a solution to this problem, constraining the magnitude of the parameters.
A different solution suggested by Bengio and Delalleau is to dynamically increase k when the model parameters increase [@Bengio2009].
These studies analysing the convergence properties and the expected approximation error for [CD](#abbrev)-k have mainly been conducted for Restricted Boltzmann Machines. 
It is therefore not clear, whether and to what extent these findings apply to the *Potts* model.

Several connections of [CD](#abbrev) to other well known approximation algorithms have been drawn. 
For example, it can be shown that [CD](#abbrev) using one Gibbs update step on a randomly selected variable is exactly equivalent to a stochastic maximum pseudo-likelihood estimation [@Hyvarinen2006; @Hyvarinen2007].
Asuncion and colleagues showed further that an arbitrary good approximation to the full likelihood can be reached by applying blocked-Gibbs sampling [@Asuncion2010].
[CD](#abbrev) based on sampling an arbitraty number of variables, has an equivalent stochastic composite likelihood, which is a higher-order generalization of the pseudo-likelihood.

Another variant of [CD](#abbrev) is [PCD](#abbrev), such that the Markov chain is not reinitialized at a data sample every time a new gradient is computed [@Tieleman2008].
Instead, the Markov chains are kept *persistent* that is, they are evolved between successive gradient computations.
The fundamental idea behind [PCD](#abbrev) is that the model changes only slowly between parameter updates given a sufficiently small learning rate.
Consequently, the Markov chains will not be pushed too far from equilibrium after each update but rather stay close to the stationary distribution [@Tieleman2008; @Murphy2012; @Fischer2012].
Tieleman and others observed that [PCD](#abbrev) performs better than [CD](#abbrev) in all practical cases tested, eventhough [CD](#abbrev) can be faster in the early stages of learning and thus should be preferred when runtime is the limiting factor [@Tieleman2008; @Murphy2012].

The next sections discuss various modifications of the [CD](#abbrev) algorithm, such as varying the regularization strength $\lambda_w$ for constraining the coupling parameters $\w$, increasing the number of Gibbs sampling steps and varying the number of Markov chains used for sampling.
Persistent contrastive divergence is analysed for various combinations of the above mentioned settings and eventually combined with [CD](#abbrev)-k. 
Unless noted otherwise, all optimizations will be performed using stochastic gradient descent with the tuned hyperparameters described in the last sections. 

### Tuning Regularization Coefficients for Contrastive Divergence {#regularization-for-cd-with-sgd}

For tuning the hyperparameters of the stochastic gradient descent optimizer in the last section \@ref(sgd-hyperparameter-tuning), the coupling parameters $\w$ were constrained by a Gaussian prior $\mathcal{N}(\w | 0, \lambda_w^{-1} I)$ using the default pseudo-likelihood regularization coefficient $\lambda_w \eq 1\mathrm{e}{-2}L$ as decscribed in methods section \@ref(methods-regularization).
It is conceivable that [CD](#abbrev) achieves optimal performance using stronger or weaker regularization than used for pseudo-likelihood optimization.
Therefore, I evaluated performance for different regularization coefficients $\lambda_w \in \{ 5\mathrm{e}{-2}L, 1\mathrm{e}{-1}L, 1\mathrm{e}{-2}L, L\}$ using the previously identified hyperparamters for [SGD](#abbrev).
The single potentials $\v$ are not subject to optimization and are kept fixed at their maximum-likelihood estimate $v^*$ that is derived in eq. \@ref(eq:prior-v). 

As can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:precison-cd-regularization), using strong regularization for the couplings, with $\lambda_w \eq L$, results in a drastic drop of mean precision.
Using weaker regularization, with $\lambda_w \eq \mathrm{5e}{-2}L$, improves precision for the top $L/10$ and $L/5$ predicted contacts but decreases precision when including lower ranked predictions.
As a matter of fact, a slightly weaker regularization $\lambda_w \eq \mathrm{1e}{-1}L$ than the default $\lambda_w \eq \mathrm{1e}{-2}L$ improves mean precision especially for the top $L/2$ contacts in such a way, that it is comparable to the pseudo-likelihood performance. 

(ref:caption-precison-cd-regularization) Mean precision for top ranked contact predictions over 300 proteins. Contact scores are computed as the [APC](#abbrev) corrected Frobenius norm of the couplings $\wij$. **pseudo-likelihood**:  couplings computed with pseudo-likelihood. **CD lambda_w = X**: couplings computed with [CD](#abbrev) using L2-regularization on the couplings $\w$ with regularization coefficient $\lambda_w$ specified in the legend and keeping the single potentials $\vi$ fixed at their [MLE](#abbrev) optimum $\vi^*$ denoted in eq. \@ref(eq:prior-v).

```{r precison-cd-regularization, echo = FALSE, screenshot.alt="img/full_likelihood/sgd/precision_vs_rank_regularizer.png", out.width = '90%', fig.align='center', fig.cap = '(ref:caption-precison-cd-regularization)'}
knitr::include_url("img/full_likelihood/sgd/precision_vs_rank_regularizer.html", height = "500px")
```

As mentioned before, in contrast to pseudo-likelihood optimization the single potentials $\v$ are not optimized with [CD](#abbrev) but rather set to their maximum-likelihood estimate as it is obtained in a single position model that is discussed in methods section \@ref(eq:prior-v).
When the single potentials $\v$ are optimized with [CD](#abbrev) using the same regularization coefficient $\lambda_v \eq 10$ as for pseudo-likelihood optimization, performance is almost indistinguishable compared to keeping the single potentials $\v$ fixed (see Appendix Figure \@ref(fig:full-likelihood-opt-fixv)).

### Varying the Sample Size {#cd-sampling-size}

The default Gibbs sampling scheme outlined in method section \@ref(methods-cd-sampling) involves the random selection of $10L$ sequences from the input alignment, with $L$ being protein length, at every iteration of the optimization procedure.
These selected sequences are used to initialize the same number of Markov chains. 
The particular choice of $10L$ sequences was motivated by the fact that there is a relationship between the precision of contacts predicted from pseudo-likelihood and protein length, at least for alignments with less than $10^3$ diverse sequences [@Anishchenko2017].
It has been argued that roughly $5L$ nonredundant sequences are required to obtain confident predictions that can bet used for protein structure prediction [@Kamisetty2013].

I analysed whether varying the number of sequences used for the approximation of the gradient via Gibbs sampling affects performance.
Randomly selecting only a subset of sequences $S$ from the $N$ sequences of the input alignment corresponds to the stochastic gradient descent idea of a minibatch and introduces additional stochasticity over the [CD](#abbrev) Gibbs sampling process. 
Using $S < N$ sequences for Gibbs sampling has the further advantage of decreasing the runtime at each iteration. 
I evaluated different schemes for the random selection of sequences:

- sampling $x$L sequences with $x \in \{ 1, 5, 10, 50 \}$ without replacement enforcing $S \eq \min(N, xL)$
- sampling $x$[Neff](#abbrev) sequences with $x \in \{ 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 \}$ without replacement

Figure \@ref(fig:cd-performance-samplesize) illustrates performance for several of the choices.
Randomly selecting $L$ sequences for sampling results in a visible drop in performance. 
There is no benefit in using more than $10L$ sequences, especially as sampling more sequences increases runtime per iteration.
Specifying the number of sequences for sampling as fractions of [Neff](#abbrev) generally improves precision slightly over selecting $10L$ or $50L$ sequences for sampling.
By sampling $0.3$[Neff](#abbrev) sequences, [CD](#abbrev) does slighty improve over pseudo-likelihood.

(ref:caption-cd-performance-samplesize) Mean precision for top ranked contact predictions over 300 proteins. Contact scores are computed as the [APC](#abbrev) corrected Frobenius norm of the couplings $\wij$. **pseudo-likelihood**:  couplings computed with pseudo-likelihood.  **CD sample size = X **: contact scores computed from [CD](#abbrev) with [SGD](#abbrev). At every iteration, a particular number of sequences is randomly selected from the input alignmet to initialize the Markoc chains for Gibbs sampling. The number of randomly selected sequences is specified in the legend. It is defined either as multiples of protein length $L$ or as fraction of the effective number of sequences [Neff](#abbrev). 

```{r cd-performance-samplesize, echo = FALSE, screenshot.alt="img/full_likelihood/gibbs_sampling/precision_vs_rank_samplesize.png", out.width = '90%', fig.align='center', fig.cap = '(ref:caption-cd-performance-samplesize)'}
knitr::include_url("img/full_likelihood/gibbs_sampling/precision_vs_rank_samplesize.html", height = "500px")
```

When evaluating performance with respect to the number of effective sequences [Neff](#abbrev), it can clearly be noted that the optimal number of randomly selected sequences should be defined as a fraction of [Neff](#abbrev). 
Selecting too many sequences, e.g. $50L$ for small alignments (left plot in Figure \@ref(fig:cd-precision-sampling-size-neff)), or selecting too few sequences, e.g $1L$ for large alignments (right plot in Figure \@ref(fig:cd-precision-sampling-size-neff)), results in a decrease in precision compared to defining the number of sequences as fractions of [Neff](#abbrev).
Especially small alignments benefit from sample sizes defined as a fraction of [Neff](#abbrev) with improvements of about three percentage points in precision over pseudo-likelihood.

(ref:caption-cd-precision-sampling-size-neff) Mean precision for top ranked contact predictions over subsets of 75 proteins, defined according to [Neff](#abbrev) quartiles. Contact scores are computed as the [APC](#abbrev) corrected Frobenius norm of the couplings $\wij$. **pseudo-likelihood**:  contact scores computed from pseudo-likelihood. **CD sample size = X **: contact scores computed from [CD](#abbrev) with [SGD](#abbrev). The number of randomly selected sequences for the Gibbs sampling process is specified in the legend. It is defined either as multiples of protein length $L$ or as fraction of the effective number of sequences [Neff](#abbrev).  **Left** Subset of 75 proteins with [Neff](#abbrev) < Q1. **Right** Subset of 75 proteins with Q3 <= [Neff](#abbrev) < Q4.

```{r cd-precision-sampling-size-neff, echo = FALSE, screenshot.alt="img/full_likelihood/gibbs_sampling/precision_vs_rank_facetted_by_neff_samplesize.png", out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap = '(ref:caption-cd-precision-sampling-size-neff)'}
knitr::include_url("img/full_likelihood/gibbs_sampling/precision_vs_rank_facetted_by_neff_samplesize.html", height = "600px")
```

To understand the effect of different choices of sample size it is necessary to look at single proteins. 
The left plot in Figure \@ref(fig:cd-samplesize-protein1c75a00) shows the development of the L2 norm of the gradient for couplings, $||\nabla_{\w} L\!L(\v^*, \w)||_2$, for protein chain 1c75A00 that is of length 71 and has [Neff](#abbrev) = 16808.
The norm of the gradient decreases during optimization and for increasing choices of the sample size it saturates at decreasing levels.
For example, increasing the sample size by a factor 100 (from $L$ to $100L$) leads to an approximately 10-fold reduction of the norm of the gradient at convergence ($\mathrm{1e}{+5}$ compared to $\mathrm{1e}{+4}$), which corresponds to a typical reduction of statistical noise as the square root of the number of samples.
It is not feasible to sample the number of sequences at each iteration that would be necessary to reduce the norm of the gradient to near zero! 

The previous benchmark showed, that precision of the top ranked contacts does not improve to the same amount as the norm of the gradient decreases when the sample size is increased.
Probably, the improved gradient when using a larger sample size helps to finetune the parameters, which only has a negligible effect on the contact score computed as [APC](#abbrev) corrected Frobenius norm of the couplings $\wij$.
For example, the difference between the parameter norm at convergence for sampling $10L = 710$ sequences or $50L = 3550$ sequences is only marginal (see right plot in Figure \@ref(fig:cd-samplesize-protein1c75a00)), despite a larger difference of the norm of gradients. 

It is not clear why an improved gradient estimate due to sampling more sequences results in weaker performance for proteins with small alignments as could be seen in the previous benchmark in Figure \@ref(fig:cd-precision-sampling-size-neff). 
Protein 1ahoA00, that has length 64 and an alignment of 378 sequences ([Neff](#abbrev)=229), achieves a mean precision of 0.44 over the top $0.1L$ - $L$ contacts when using all $N \eq 378$ sequences for sampling. When only $0.3N_{\textrm{eff}} \eq 69$ sequences are used in the sampling procedure, 1ahoA00 achieves a mean precision of 0.62.
Appendix Figure \@ref(fig:cd-samplesize-protein1ahoa00) shows the course of the norm of the gradient and the norm of coupling parameters during optimization for this protein. 
Similarly as it has been observed for protein 1c75A00, the norm of the gradient converges towards smaller values when more sequences are used in the Gibbs sampling process and the improved gradient is supposed to lead to a better approximation of the likelihood.
One explanation for this obvious discrepancy could be some effect of overfitting. 
Eventhough a regularizer is used for optimization and the norm of coupling parameters actually is smaller when using a larger sample size (see the right plot in Appendix Figure \@ref(fig:cd-samplesize-protein1ahoa00)). 

(ref:caption-cd-samplesize-protein1c75a00) Monitoring parameter norm and gradient norm for protein 1c75A00 during [SGD](#abbrev) using different sample sizes. Protein 1c75A00 has length L=71 and 28078 sequences in the alignment ([Neff](#abbrev)=16808). The number of sequences, that is used for Gibbs sampling to approximate the gradient, is given in the legend with 1L = 71 sequences, 5L = 355 sequences, 10L = 710 sequences, 50L = 3550 sequences, 100L = 7100 sequences, 0.2Neff = 3362 sequences, 0.3Neff = 5042 sequences, 0.4Neff = 6723 sequences.  **Left** L2-norm of the gradients for coupling parameters, $||\nabla_{\w} L\!L(\v^*, \w)||_2$ (without contribution of regularizer).  **Right** L2-norm of the coupling parameters $||\w||_2$.

### Varying the number of Gibbs Steps  {#cd-gibbs-steps}

As discussed earlier, it has been pointed out in the literature that using $k>1$ Gibbs steps for sampling sequences gives more precise results at the cost of longer runtimes per gradient evaluation [@Bengio2009; @Tieleman2008].
I analysed the impact on performance when the number of Gibbs steps is increased to 5 and 10.
As can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:precision-cd-gibbs-steps), increasing the number of Gibbs steps does result in a slight drop of performance.
When evaluating precision with respect to [Neff](#abbrev) it can be found that using more Gibbs sampling steps is especially disadvantageous for large alignments (see Appendix Figure \@ref(fig:cd-precision-gibbssteps-neff)). 


(ref:caption-precision-cd-gibbs-steps) Mean precision for top ranked contact predictions over 300 proteins. Contact scores are computed as the [APC](#abbrev) corrected Frobenius norm of the couplings $\wij$. **pseudo-likelihood**:  contact scores computed from pseudo-likelihood. **CD #Gibbs steps = X**: contact scores computed from [CD](#abbrev) optimized with [SGD](#abbrev) and evolving each Markov chain using the number of Gibbs steps specified in the legend. 

```{r precision-cd-gibbs-steps, echo = FALSE, screenshot.alt="img/full_likelihood/gibbs_sampling/precision_vs_rank_gibbssteps.png", out.width = '90%', fig.align='center', fig.cap = '(ref:caption-precision-cd-gibbs-steps)'}
knitr::include_url("img/full_likelihood/gibbs_sampling/precision_vs_rank_gibbssteps.html", height = "500px")
```

When evaluating single proteins, it can be observed that for proteins with small alignments the L2 norm of the parameters, $||\w||_2$, converges towards a different offset when using more than one Gibbs steps (see left plot in Figure \@ref(fig:cd-gibbssteps-single-proteins)). 
Naturally, the Markov chains can wander further away from their initialization when they are evolved over a longer time which results in a stronger gradient at the beginning of the optimization. 
Therefore and because the initial learning rate has been optimized for sampling with one Gibbs step, the parameter norm overshoots the optimum at the beginning.
Even when lowering the initial learning rate from $\alpha_0 = \frac{5e-2}{\sqrt{N_{\text{eff}}}}$ to $\alpha_0 \in \left \{ \frac{3e-2}{\sqrt{N_{\text{eff}}}}, \frac{2e-2}{\sqrt{N_{\text{eff}}}} , \frac{1e-2}{\sqrt{N_{\text{eff}}}}  \right \}$, the [SGD](#abbrev) optimizer evidently approaches a different optimum.
Surprisingly, the different optimum that is found for proteins with small alignments has no substantial impact on precision, as becomes evident from Figure \@ref(fig:cd-precision-gibbssteps-neff).
For proteins with large alignments it can be observed that there is not one alternative solution to the parameters, but depending on the number of Gibbs steps and on the initial learning rate, $\alpha_0$, the L2 norm over parameters converges towards various different offsets (see right plot in Figure \@ref(fig:cd-gibbssteps-single-proteins)).
It is not clear how these observations can be interpreted, in particular given the fact, that the L2 norm of gradients, $||\nabla_{\w} L\!L(\v^*, \w)||_2$, converges to the identical offset for all settings regardless of alignment size (see Appendix Figure \@ref(fig:cd-gibbssteps-single-proteins-gradient)).
Optimizing [CD](#abbrev) with 10 Gibbs steps and using a smaller initial learning rate, $\alpha0 = \frac{2e-2}{\sqrt{N_{\text{eff}}}}$, does not have an overal impact on mean precision as can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:precision-cd-gibbs-steps).

(ref:caption-cd-gibbssteps-single-proteins) Monitoring parameter norm, $||\w||_2$, for protein 1aho_A_00 and 1c75_A_00 during [SGD](#abbrev) optimization using different number of Gibbs steps and initial learning rates, $\alpha_0$.

```

### Persistent Contrastive Divergence  {#cd-gibbs-steps} 

Finally I analysed [PCD](#abbrev) since it has often been found to be a better estimator of the likelihood gradient than [CD](#abbrev).
It has been suggested to use [PCD](#abbrev) with small learning rates and larger mini-batches because the fundamental assumption is that the model does not change to quickly over iterations and therefore the Markov chains will stay close to the equilibrium distribition. 
However, using smaller learning rates and larger minibatches not only increases runtime but also requires tuning of the learning rate and learning rate schedule. 
Since it has been found, that CD is faster in learning at the beginning of the optimization, I tested a compromise, that uses CD-1 at the beginning of the optimization and when learning slows down, measured as the relative change of the norm of coupling parameters, I start PCD. 
This also has the advantage that the model has already approached the optimum and the parameters $\w$ will almost be constant over many updates. 




As PCD might require samller update steps and larger minibatches, I analysed the performance of PCD for the default settings of CD and additionally for smaller learning and decay rates and larger minibatches.
Note that one Markov chain is kept for every sequence of the input alignment. At each iteration a subset $N^{\prime} < N$ of the Markov chains is randomly selected (without replacement) and used to for another round of Gibss sampling at the current iteration.

PLOT PCD for different LEARNIGN  RATEWS and SAMPLE SIZES


Discussion:
- as could be seen: improved gradients and different solutions do not translate into improved precision of top ranked contacts
- APC corrected l2norm might not be an appropriate measure for CD couplings:
  look at correlation plot of couplings (pll vs cd) and l2norm (pll vs cd) and apc l2norm  (pll vs cd) -> differences vanish
- ranking of residues might not be influenced by subtle changes in parameters when crude l2norm is computed -> rank plot: merged list of top ranked contacts from both methods
  what can we see: 
    - generally pll has stronger scores (see also boxplot over all proteins? statistic?)
    - ranking is very similar, especially for top ranked contacts (thats why benchmark plots so similar)


## Using ADAM to optimize Contrastive Divergence {#adam-results}

It is possible that the learning rate schedule and decay rate need to be tuned with respect to the number of Gibbs steps used for sampling because different choices of Gibbs steps influence the size of the gradient. 
The same might apply to usign persistent contrasticve divergence.

Hyperparameter optimization with stochastic gradient descent is a time-consuming task requiring manual intervention for each of the different settings. 
There exist many variants of stochastic gradient descent algorithms that deal with the aforementioned challenges e.g. speeding up convergence rates using momentum or defining adaptive learning rates for each parameter [@Ruder2017]. 
One of these [SGD](#abbrev) variants is Adaptive Moment Estimation (*ADAM*) [@Kingma2014], an algorithm that computes per-parameter learning rates including momentum (see methods section \@ref(methods-full-likelihood-adam) for details). 
A major advantage of *ADAM* over pure [SGD](#abbrev) is that it does not require tuning many hyperparameters as the default values have been found to work quite well. 
*ADAM* will be compared to the manually tuned [SGD](#abbrev) optimizer in section \@ref(adam-results).
I used *ADAM* to find out whether its automatic adjusting of learning rates can find better parameter estimates than [sgd] for using different gibbs steps and pcd.


A problem when using *ADAM* is that the necessarty condidtion $\sum_{a,b=1}^{20} \wijab = 0$ is violated (see section \@ref(convergence-criteria-sgd)).

Comparing the ranking:
geiler plot
ranking ist sehr aehnlich, besonders fuer top contacts
nur diese drei outlier sind bei CD sehr viel hoeher gerankt als bei pLL

```{r comparing-cd-pll-ranking, echo = FALSE, screenshot.alt="img/aa_venn_diagram.png", out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap = 'dideldum'}
