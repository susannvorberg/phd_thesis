# Introduction {#general-intro}

In his Nobel Prize speech in 1973 [@Anfinsen1973] Anfinsen postulated one of the basic principles in molecular biology, which is known as *Anfinsen's dogma*: a protein's native structure is uniquely determined by its amino acid sequence. 
With certain exceptions (e.g. [IDP](#abbrev) [@Wright1999]), this dogma has proven to hold true for the majority of proteins.

Ever since, it is regarded as the biggest challenge in structural bioinformatics [@Samish2015], to realiably predict a protein's structure given only its amino acid sequence. 
*De-novo* protein structure prediction methods use physical or knowledge based energy potentials to find a protein conformation that minimizes the protein's energy landscape. 
However, these methods are limited by the complexity of the conformational space and the accuracy of the energy potentials. 
Considering a protein with 150 amino acids, that has approximately 450 degrees of freedom, 
Regarding the rotational and translational degrees of freedom of the protein chain, the complexity scales with XXX [@Anfinsen1973].

Far more successfull are template-based modelling approaches. 
Given the observation that structure is more conserved than sequence in a protein family [@Lesk1980], the structure of a target protein can be inferred from a homologue protein [@Sander1991]. 
The degree of structural conservation is linked to the level of pairwise sequence identity [@Chothia1986]. 
Therefore, the accuracy of a model crucially depends on the sequence identity between target and template and determines the applicability of the model [@Marti-Renom2000]. 
By definition, homology derived models are unable to capture new folds [@Dorn2014] and their main limitation lies in the availability of suitable templates.

```

Unfortunately, the number of solved protein structures increases only slowly, as experimental methods are both time consuming and expensive [@Dorn2014].
The [PDB](#abbrev)[@Berman2000] is the main repository for marcomolecular structures and currently (Jul 2017) holds about 120 000 atomic models of proteins. 
The primary technique for determining protein structures is X-ray crystallography, accounting for roughly 90% of entries in the [PDB](#abbrev). 
About 9% of protein structures have been solved using [NMR](#abbrev) and less than 1% using [EM](#abbrev) (see FIG 1).

All three experimental techniques have advantages and limitations with respect to certain modelling aspects.
X-ray crystallography requires the protein to form crystals, which is an arduous and sometimes impossible task. 
Furthermore, crystal packing forces the protein into a unnatural and rigid environment preventing the observation of conformational flexibility. 
NMR studies the protein in an physiological environment in solution and enables the study of protein dynamics as ensembles of protein structures can be observed. However, NMR is limited to look at small proteins. 
Recently, EM has undergone a "resolution revolution" [@Egelman2016] and macromolecular structures have been solved with resolutions up to 2A[citation]. 
The limit of cryo-EM lies in the size of proteins.

Compared to the tedious task of revealing atomic resolution of a protein tertiary structure, it has become very easy to decipher the primary sequence of proteins. 
With the latest sequencing technologies [examples], it takes only hours to sequence millions of basepaires at low costs [example numbers] and the number of sequenced genomes has risen tremendously.
The UniProtKB [@TheUniProtConsortium2013], the leading resource for protein sequences, contains more than 80 million sequence entries (24 July 2017). 
 
Consequently, the gap between the number of protein structures and sequences is still growing and even new developments as single protein structure determination [@CITE] are not expected to close this gap near in time.

Protein structure determines protein function. Therefore, structural insights are of uttermost importance. They are essential for a detailed understanding of chemical reactions, regulatory processes and transport mechanisms.
They are fundamental for the design of drugs and antibiotics. Moreover structural abnormalities can lead to misfolding and aggregation potentially causing diseases so studying them is pathologically relevant.

The aformentioned trends illustrate the need of computational methods and motivate research to solve *Ansinsens Dogma* to reliably predict protein structures from sequence alone. 


"At the cost of months or years of laborious work, these methods can produce high-resolution structures at the atomic level. The structures of many proteins or protein complexes cannot be determined using these methods because of the specific physical and chemical properties of these proteins or complexes.On the other hand, the knowledge of these protein structures is very important to elucidate their biological functions due to the close relationship between structure and function.Therefore, there is a pressing need for developing new methods to both increase the speed and broaden the target spectrum of protein structure determination with the rapid growth of the number of the identified proteins from genomic1,2 and proteomic studies."[@Chen2007]

### Amino Acid Interactions {#amino-acid-interactions}

The Venn diagram in figure \@ref(fig:amino-acid-physico-chemical-properties) displays a typical classification of amino acids with respect to their physico-chemical properties. 


The aromatic amino acids tryptophan (W), tyrosine (Y), phenylalanine (F), and histidine (H) contain an aromatic ring system. 
Generally, aromatic ring systems are planar, and electons are shared over the whole ring structure.
Interactions between aromatic residues have very constrained geometries regarding the angle between the centroid of their rings. 
The $\pi$-electron systems favour T-shaped or offset stacked conformations [@Waters2002].
Preferred distances between aromatic residues have been observed between 4.5$\angstrom$ and 7$\angstrom$ of their ring centroids [@Burley1985].

Cysteine (C) residues can form disulphide bonds, which are the only covalent bonds between two amino acid side chains.
They comprise the strongest side chain interactions in protein structures and their length varies between 3.5$\angstrom$ to 4$\angstrom$.
Disulphide bonds also have a well defined geometry: there are five dihedral angles in a disulphide bond resulting in 20 different possible configurations. 
Only one configuration is favoured so that the dihedral angle between the carbon and sulfur atoms is close to 90 degrees [@Thornton1981].
They play a very important role in stabilizing protein structures. 
The number of disulfide bonds is negatively correlated with protein length: smaller proteins have more disulfide bonds helping to stabilize the structure in absence of strong hydrophobic packing in the core.
It has also been found that disulfide bonds are more frequently observed in proteins of hyperthermophilic bacteria, being positively selected for increased stability [@Bastolla2005].

Salt bridges are based on electrostatic interactions between positively charged residues (arginine (R) and lysine (K)) and negatively charged residues (aspartic acid (D) and glutamic acid (E)). 
The strength of electrostatic interactions, as described by Coulomb's law, decreases with distance between the point charges at the functional groups. 
It has been found to be maximal at 4$\angstrom$ with respect to the functional groups of the both residues [@Donald2011].

Hydrogen bonds can be formed between a donor residue which possesses an hydrogen atom attached to a strongly electronegative atom and an acceptor residue which possesses an electronegative atom with a lone electron pair. 
They are electrostatic interactions as well and thus their strength depends on distance as well. 
Hydrogen bonds are formed at distances of 2.4$\angstrom$ to 3.5$\angstrom$ between the non-hydrogen atoms (Berg JM, Tymoczko JL, 2002).

Salt bridges as well as hydrogen bonds have strong geometric preferences (Kumar and Nussinov, 1999). 
The geometry of a hydrogen bond depends on the angle between the HB donor, the hydrogen atom and the HB acceptor (Torshin et al., 2002).

Cationâ€“$\pi$ interactions are formed between positively charged or partially charged amino acids with amino groups (K,R,Q,E) and aromatic residues (W,Y,F,H). 
The preferential distance of the amino group to the $\pi$-electron system has been determined between 3.4$\angstrom$ and 6$\angstrom$ [@Burley1986] [@Crowley2005]
Their role in stabilizing protein structures is still under debate [@Slutsky2004].

Proline residues are conformationally restricted, with the alpha-amino group of the backbone directly attached to the side chain. 
The sterical rigidity of the proline side chain restricts the backbone angle and thus affects secondary structure formation.
Proline is known as a helix-breaker. 
Whereas other aromatic side chains are defined by their negatively charged $\pi$ faces, the face of proline side chains is partially positively charged.
Thus, aromatic and proline residues can interact favorably with each other.
Once due to the hydrophobic nature of the residues and also due to the interaction between the negatively charged aroamtic $\pi$ face and the polarized C-H bonds in proline, called a CH/$\pi$  interaction.

Petersen et al. (2012) found clear secondary structure elements preferences for each amino acid pair. 
For example, residue pairs containing Alanine and Leucine are predominantly found in buried $\alpha$-helices, whereas pairs containing Isoleucine and Valine preferentially are located in $\beta$-sheet environments. 
Of course, solvent accessibility represents an important criterion for residue interactions. 
Hydrophobic residues are rather buried in the structure, whereas polar and charged residues are found more frequently on the protein surface and interact with water molecules.

## Structure Prediction

Despite the knowledge of Anfinsen's postulate, we are not able to reliably predict the structure of a protein from its sequence alone. Generally it is assumed that a protein folds into a unique, well-defined native structure that is near the global free energy minimum (fig:folding_funnel). Levinthal's paradox [@Levinthal1969] describes the complexity of the folding process towards this minimum. It stresses the problem that it is not possible for a protein to exhaustively search the conformational space to get to its native fold. Due to the "combinatorial explosion" of possible conformations, an exhaustive search would take unreasonably long. Hence, it is not a feasible approach for structure prediction to scan all possible conformations. Different approaches have been developed over time to overcome or elude this problem.


### Template-based methods

Homology modeling is by far the most successful approach to structure prediction. 
The basic concept of this strategy relates to the fact that structure is more conserved than sequence [@Lesk1980]. 
After detecting a homologous protein of known structure, that has sufficient sequence similarity, it can be used as a template to model the structure of the target protein.

The degree of structural conservation is linked to the level of pariwise sequence identity [@Chothia1986]. 
Homology Modelling is assumed to yield reliably accurate models when query and target protein share more than 30$\%$ sequence similarity, depending on the sequence length (*safe homology zone*) [@Sander1991]. 
Below a threshold of ~20-35% pairwise sequence identity (*twighlight-zone*) the number of false positives regarding structural similarity explodes and structural inference becomes less reliable and more than 95% of structures are dissmilar [@Rost1999]. 
Advances in remote homology detection and alignment generation have improved the quality of models, even beyond the once postulated limit of the *twighlight-zone* [@Yan2013].
Integration of multiple templates has also proved to increase model quality [@Meier2015]

After the identification of a suitable template, there are different strategies that can be followed to obtain a model for the target protein. 
The the backbone of the model is generated by simply copying the coordinates of the target backbone atoms onto the model. 
Non-aligned residues due to gaps in the alignment have to be modelled $\textit{de-novo}$, meaning from scratch.
This can be done by a knowledge-based search for suitable fragments in the PDB or by true energy-based $\textit{de-novo}$ modelling. 
When the backbone is generated, the side chains are modelled, usually by searching rotamer libraries for energetically favoured residue conformations. 
Finally, the model is energetically optimized in an iterative procedure. 
Force fields are applied to correct the backbone and side chain conformations [@Gu2009]. 
Several automated pipelines for homology modelling are well-established (Modeller [@Eswar2007], 3D-Jigsaw [@Bates2001], SwissModel [@Arnold2006]) which allow more or less manual intervention in the modelling process. 

        
Fold Recognition describes the inverse folding problem [Bowie1993]: instead of finding the compatible structure for a given sequence, one tries to find sequences that fit onto a given structure. Whether the query sequence fits a structure from the database is not determined by sequence similarities but rather energetic or environment specific measures. Thus, fold recognition methods are able to recognize structural similarity even in the absence of sequence similarity. The rationale basis for this strategy is the assumption that the fold space is limited. It has been found that seemingly unrelated proteins often adopt similar folds. This might be due to divergent evolution (proteins are related, but homology cannot be detected at the corresponding sequence level) or convergent evolution (functional requirements lead to similar folds for unrelated proteins) [Gu2009]. Early approaches include profile based methods. Here, the structural information of the protein is encoded into profiles, which subsequently are aligned to the sequences [Bowie1991,Fischer1996,Ouzounis1993]. Advanced techniques are known as  "threading" techniques, describing the process of threading a sequence through a structure and determining the optimal fit via energy functions. [Jones1992,Jones1998,Lemer1995]


### Template-free structure prediction

Ab initio or de-novo modeling techniques implement Anfinsenâ€™s Dogma most closely in mimicking the folding process based only on physico-chemical principles.
Energy functions (physical or knowledge-based) are used to describe the folding landscape and are minimized to arrive at the global energy minimum corresponding to the native conformation. 
Since the native conformation can be found near the global energy minimum of the folding landscape, energy functions (physical or knowledge-based) have been developed to describe this landscape.
With respect to the idea of a folding funnel, the energy function is minimized to mimic the folding process that automatically leads to the global minimum.
 Again, there exist numerous webservers that combine energy minimization,  threading techniques and fragment-based approaches, e.g. Rosetta [\citep{]Simons1999], Tasser [Zhang2004, Touchstone II Zhang2003].

Drawbacks of these methods are the time requirements due to the computational complexity of energy functions as well as their inaccuracy. 
    
    

Minimize a physical or knowledge-based energy function for the protein. This has huge complexity due to large conformational space that needs to be sampled.
