# Introduction

In his Nobel Prize speech in 1973 [@Anfinsen1973] Anfinsen postulated one of the basic principles in molecular biology, which is known as *Anfinsen's dogma*: a protein's native structure is uniquely determined by its amino acid sequence. 
With certain exceptions (e.g. [IDP](#abbrev) [@Wright1999]), this dogma has proven to hold true for the majority of proteins.

Ever since, it is regarded as the biggest challenge in structural bioinformatics [@Samish2015], to realiably predict a protein's structure given only its amino acid sequence. 
*De-novo* protein structure prediction methods use physical or knowledge based energy potentials to find a protein conformation that minimizes the protein's energy landscape. 
However, these methods are limited by the complexity of the conformational space and the accuracy of the energy potentials. 
Considering a protein with 150 amino acids, that has approximately 450 degrees of freedom, 
Regarding the rotational and translational degrees of freedom of the protein chain, the complexity scales with XXX [@Anfinsen1973].

Far more successfull are template-based modelling approaches. 
Given the observation that structure is more conserved than sequence in a protein family [@Lesk1980], the structure of a target protein can be inferred from a homologue protein [@Sander1991]. 
The degree of structural conservation is linked to the level of pairwise sequence identity [@Chothia1986]. 
Therefore, the accuracy of a model crucially depends on the sequence identity between target and template and determines the applicability of the model [@Marti-Renom2000]. 
By definition, homology derived models are unable to capture new folds [@Dorn2014] and their main limitation lies in the availability of suitable templates.  

```{r seq-str-gap, echo = FALSE, out.width = '100%', out.height = '100%', fig.cap = 'Yearly growth of number of solved structures in the PDB[@Berman2000] and protein sequences in the Uniprot[@TheUniProtConsortium2013].'}
knitr::include_url("img/pdb_growth.html")
```

Unfortunately, the number of solved protein structures increases only slowly, as experimental methods are both time consuming and expensive [@Dorn2014].
The [PDB](#abbrev)[@Berman2000] is the main repository for marcomolecular structures and currently (Jul 2017) holds about 120 000 atomic models of proteins. 
The primary technique for determining protein structures is X-ray crystallography, accounting for roughly 90% of entries in the [PDB](#abbrev). 
About 9% of protein structures have been solved using [NMR](#abbrev) and less than 1% using [EM](#abbrev) (see FIG 1).

All three experimental techniques have advantages and limitations with respect to certain modelling aspects.
X-ray crystallography requires the protein to form crystals, which is an arduous and sometimes impossible task. 
Furthermore, crystal packing forces the protein into a unnatural and rigid environment preventing the observation of conformational flexibility. 
$\ac{NMR}$ studies the protein in an physiological environment in solution and enables the study of protein dynamics as ensembles of protein structures can be observed. However, $\ac{NMR}$ is limited to look at small proteins. 
Recently, $\ac{EM}$ has undergone a "resolution revolution" [@Egelman2016] and macromolecular structures have been solved with resolutions up to 2A[citation]. 
The limit of $\ac{cryo-EM}$ lies in the size of proteins.

Compared to the tedious task of revealing atomic resolution of a protein tertiary structure, it has become very easy to decipher the primary sequence of proteins. 
With the latest sequencing technologies [examples], it takes only hours to sequence millions of basepaires at low costs [example numbers] and the number of sequenced genomes has risen tremendously.
The UniProtKB [@TheUniProtConsortium2013], the leading resource for protein sequences, contains more than 80 million sequence entries (24 July 2017). 
 
Consequently, the gap between the number of protein structures and sequences is still growing and even new developments as single protein structure determination [@CITE] are not expected to close this gap near in time.

Protein structure determines protein function. Therefore, structural insights are of uttermost importance. They are essential for a detailed understanding of chemical reactions, regulatory processes and transport mechanisms.
They are fundamental for the design of drugs and antibiotics. Moreover structural abnormalities can lead to misfolding and aggregation potentially causing diseases so studying them is pathologically relevant.

The aformentioned trends illustrate the need of computational methods and motivate research to solve *Ansinsens Dogma* to reliably predict protein structures from sequence alone. 



## Structure Prediction

Despite the knowledge of Anfinsen's postulate, we are not able to reliably predict the structure of a protein from its sequence alone. Generally it is assumed that a protein folds into a unique, well-defined native structure that is near the global free energy minimum (\autoref{fig:folding_funnel}). Levinthal's paradox [@Levinthal1969] describes the complexity of the folding process towards this minimum. It stresses the problem that it is not possible for a protein to exhaustively search the conformational space to get to its native fold. Due to the "combinatorial explosion" of possible conformations, an exhaustive search would take unreasonably long. Hence, it is not a feasible approach for structure prediction to scan all possible conformations. Different approaches have been developed over time to overcome or elude this problem.


### Template-based methods

Homology modeling is by far the most successful approach to structure prediction. 
The basic concept of this strategy relates to the fact that structure is more conserved than sequence [@Lesk1980]. 
After detecting a homologous protein of known structure, that has sufficient sequence similarity, it can be used as a template to model the structure of the target protein.

The degree of structural conservation is linked to the level of pariwise sequence identity [@Chothia1986]. 
Homology Modelling is assumed to yield reliably accurate models when query and target protein share more than 30\% sequence similarity, depending on the sequence length (*safe homology zone*) [@Sander1991]. 
Below a threshold of ~20-35% pairwise sequence identity (*twighlight-zone*) the number of false positives regarding structural similarity explodes and structural inference becomes less reliable and more than 95% of structures are dissmilar [@Rost1999]. 
Advances in remote homology detection and alignment generation have improved the quality of models, even beyond the once postulated limit of the *twighlight-zone* [@Yan2013].
Integration of multiple templates has also proved to increase model quality [@Meier2015]

After the identification of a suitable template, there are different strategies that can be followed to obtain a model for the target protein. 
The the backbone of the model is generated by simply copying the coordinates of the target backbone atoms onto the model. 
Non-aligned residues due to gaps in the alignment have to be modelled \textit{de-novo}, meaning from scratch.
This can be done by a knowledge-based search for suitable fragments in the PDB or by true energy-based \textit{de-novo} modelling. 
When the backbone is generated, the side chains are modelled, usually by searching rotamer libraries for energetically favoured residue conformations. 
Finally, the model is energetically optimized in an iterative procedure. 
Force fields are applied to correct the backbone and side chain conformations [@Gu2009}. 
Several automated pipelines for homology modelling are well-established (Modeller [@Eswar2007}, 3D-Jigsaw [@Bates2001}, SwissModel [@Arnold2006}) which allow more or less manual intervention in the modelling process. 

        
Fold Recognition describes the inverse folding problem \citep{Bowie1993}: instead of finding the compatible structure for a given sequence, one tries to find sequences that fit onto a given structure. Whether the query sequence fits a structure from the database is not determined by sequence similarities but rather energetic or environment specific measures. Thus, fold recognition methods are able to recognize structural similarity even in the absence of sequence similarity. The rationale basis for this strategy is the assumption that the fold space is limited. It has been found that seemingly unrelated proteins often adopt similar folds. This might be due to divergent evolution (proteins are related, but homology cannot be detected at the corresponding sequence level) or convergent evolution (functional requirements lead to similar folds for unrelated proteins) \citep{Gu2009}. Early approaches include profile based methods. Here, the structural information of the protein is encoded into profiles, which subsequently are aligned to the sequences \citep{Bowie1991,Fischer1996,Ouzounis1993}. Advanced techniques are known as  "threading" techniques, describing the process of threading a sequence through a structure and determining the optimal fit via energy functions. \citep{Jones1992,Jones1998,Lemer1995}


### Template-free structure prediction

Ab initio or de-novo modeling techniques implement Anfinsenâ€™s Dogma most closely in mimicking the folding process based only on physico-chemical principles.
Energy functions (physical or knowledge-based) are used to describe the folding landscape and are minimized to arrive at the global energy minimum corresponding to the native conformation. 
Since the native conformation can be found near the global energy minimum of the folding landscape, energy functions (physical or knowledge-based) have been developed to describe this landscape.
With respect to the idea of a folding funnel, the energy function is minimized to mimic the folding process that automatically leads to the global minimum.
 Again, there exist numerous webservers that combine energy minimization,  threading techniques and fragment-based approaches, e.g. Rosetta \citep{Simons1999}, Tasser \citep{Zhang2004}, Touchstone II \citep{Zhang2003}.

Drawbacks of these methods are the time requirements due to the computational complexity of energy functions as well as their inaccuracy. 
    
    

Minimize a physical or knowledge-based energy function for the protein. This has huge complexity due to large conformational space that needs to be sampled. 

### contact assisted denovo predictions

Structure Reconstruction from true contacts maps works well. Even a small number of contacts is sufficient to reconstruct the fold of the protein. Distance maps work even better. 

What is the optimal distance cutoff to define a contact? 
Duarte et al 2010: between 8 and 12A
Dyrka et al 2016
Konopka et al 2014
Sathyapriya et al 2009

Many studies that successfuly predict structures denovo with the help of predicted contact.

## Contact Prediction

### Correlated mutations

contact prediction methods aim to identify correlated mutations from an  alignment of homologue protein sequences. 
main assumption is that two interacting amino acid residues are coevolving: mutation of one of the two residues can be compensated by mutation of the other residue

### Benchmarking methods

- threshold for defining a contact: 
usually distance between $C_\beta$ atoms ($C_\alpha$ for Glycin) < 8 angstrom. 

- PPV: TP/(FP+TP)
fraction of correct predictions among all predictions

### Pitfalls

Coevolution of residues can be mediated by molecules (e.g zinc ions) and will not always imply spatial proximity in structure. Transitivity can lead to correlation signals. Phylogenetic bias can also lead to correlations. Sampling bias needs to be taken into account. 


## State of the Art CP

###Correlation vs Causation

A recurring difficulty when dealing with interacting systems is distinguishing the direct interactions, resulting from adjacent interplay between two units, from interactions mediated via multi-step paths across other elements [Ekeberg master thesis]

### Local methods
MI and correlation measures suffer from transitivity of correlations

### Direct coupling analysis {#dca}
Can disentangle direct and indirect correlations.

Infer parameters of a maximum entropy model, more specifically a Potts model (statistical physics) aka markov random fiels (computer science).
Likelihood function is convex, but Maximum Likelihood inference of model is infeasible: 
Likelihood function needs to be reevaluated at each iteration during optimization but partition function term sums over 20^L sequences.


Many approximations:
- mean field (Marks), Psicov
- pseudo-likelihood 
- belief-propagation (accurate but slow)

#### Pseudo-Likelihood

the proba- bility of them-th observation, xm, is approximated by the product of the conditional probabilities[@Stein2015a]

Recall from above that our pseudo-likelihood uses the full representation and fixes the gauge by the regularization terms Rl2. Our procedure is therefore first to infer the
interaction parameters using using the pseudo-likelihood and the regularization, and then change to the zero-sum gauge [@Ekeberg2013]


On one hand, this improvement might not be surpris-ing: it is known that, for very large data sets, pseudo- likelihood maximization becomes asymptotically equiva- lent to full maximum-likelihood inference, whereas mean- field inference remains intrinsically approximate, and this may result in an improved PLM performance. On the other hand, the above advantage holds if and only if the following two conditions are fulfilled: data a drawn independently from a probability distribution, and this probability distribution is the the Boltzmann distribution of a Potts model. None of these two con- ditions actually hold for real protein sequences [@Ekeberg2013]


Disregarding the improvements, we find that overall
the predicted contact pairs for plmDCA and mfDCA are highly overlapping, illustrating the robustness of DCA results with respect to the algorithmic implementation[@Ekeberg2013]

The pseudo-likelihood inherits the concavity[@Stein2015a]

### Computing contact map from coupling matrix

- direct information
- frobenius norm

average product correction (also for MI)

(benchmark plot for localmethods + ccmpred)

### Meta-predictors

- combining different approaches
 - jones et al: overlap between methods but also many unique predictions
- machine learning methods incorporate sequence-derived features:
  - secondary structure predictions
  - solvent accessibilty
  - contact potentials
  - msa properties
  - pssms 
  - physico-chemcial properties of amino acids

However, Meta-predictors will improve if basic methods improve. Ultra-deep learning paper identifies coevolution features as crucial feature.
